Before creating an issue for a configuration example, you must be aware:
- Your code will be released under ISC/OpenBSD License
- Your documentation will be released under Creative Common

Here a quick checklist to commit a configuration:

- [ ] hardware (e.g. manufacturer and device)
- [ ] version (e.g. operating system version, software version...)
- [ ] context (e.g. why?)
- [ ] sanitized configuration  (e.g. anonymized data)
- [ ] references and resources (e.g. links, books...)
