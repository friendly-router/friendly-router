> AXIMCom's bandwidth management solutions originated as a result of
> research to solve unstable bandwidth issues for a university student
> residence. The student residence accommodated 80 people who shared a
> single ADSL line. The institution received many congestion and
> non-connectivity complaints so they turned to us for a solution.
