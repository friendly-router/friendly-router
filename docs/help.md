## FAQ

### How to contribute?

You can read the documentation available in [contribute](/contribute)
page.

### How the database is organized?

This database should be easy to use, easy to update and easy to
share. Every information added there are mainly textual resources or
links to other one.

 1. **directories are identifiers**. Manufacturers and devices are
    represented as directories. The description of this element is
    stored in `README.md` file, translated in `index.html` file with
    vuepress.
 
 2. **files are textual documents**. Markdown is easy to edit, easy to
    read and easy to share. Specification and convention need to be
    added to ensure the coherence between each manufacturers and
    devices.
